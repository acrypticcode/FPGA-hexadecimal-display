# FPGA Hexadecimal Display

## Description
The objective of this project was to use VHDL to create a useful component and implement it on an FPGA chip. I used Xilinx Vivado software to implement a generic 7-segment output component and used it to provide output for a 4-bit input. I then tested proper functionality of the circuit. The FPGA board's slide switches are used for inputting a 4-bit binary number, and the hexadecimal equivalent outputted on one of the seven segment displays.
